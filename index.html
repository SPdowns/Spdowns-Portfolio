        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I come from San Diego. Actually, I was born in Germany, but was only there for maybe 2 or 3 weeks, my father left the service immediately after. Before coming to Epicodus, I had 3 career paths:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Audio Engineering</li>
          <p>In 2003, I started recording music with friends. In 2005, I began recording others professionally. I had a professional grade studio; a live sound package for small groups; and basic musician skills. After two years of barley making money, I switched career paths.</p>
          <li>Sketch Comedy Writer</li>
          <p>After falling out of love with recording music, I chose to move to Los Angeles and enter the sketch comedy scene. I tried improv and standup, but sketch comedy is what I truly loved and attempted to break into comedy, professionally, through that path. After almost four years of not moving fast enough, I had to return to San Diego.</p>
          <li>Retail</li>
          <p>After all else failed, retail is where I fell down too. Enjoying people, I thought I could feel content with making a living in that kind of profession. Unfortunately, employees don't make a livable wage, customers aren't considered people, and being treated sub-humanly finally took its toll.</p>
        </ol>
          <p>I chose to learn coding with Epicodus because all the positive changes I've heard occurring in people's lives who were able to attend. Not only are we accumulating programming knowledge, we're also meta learning; learning how to learn if you will. We're learning to work with others and gain soft social working skills. Focusing on the whole professional experience instead of just the facts I feel will lead to more rewarding experiences. And especially excited about Resume and Cover letter training and the mock interviews. If my confidence rises with applying for work, then I know I will have a life that isn't plagued by failing to earn a wage that can support me and a family.</p><br>
          <h5 class="right-align">2020/05/29</h5>
          <p>This will be my 2nd time going through Intro here at Epicodus. I'm so very thrilled at what I've learned this week. The first time I took the first time wasn't too confusing, besides all the remote hiccups. This time, while doing all the work I was able to see what I missed and understand and be comfortable the next time I feel like I'm not getting all the material. I'm developing better habits for note taking and have a better understanding of what my day should be structured like. I'm able to look ahead and can see myself completing the program clearer than before. Like someone said this week, "Learning to live with the anxiety that comes not knowing everything is the hardest part." I physically need to remind myself that every hour, and this go around I'm confident I'll know how to.</p>
